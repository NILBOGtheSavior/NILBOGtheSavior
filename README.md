### About me

I enjoy experimenting with different technologies to understand the systems behind them. My projects often begin as learning exercises and grow into practical tools or experiences.

### Current Projects

- **[No Static](https://github.com/NILBOGtheSavior/no-static)** - Horror jam game built in Godot with procedural noise shaders and dynamic difficulty scaling.
- **[Poker Equity Neural Network](https://github.com/NILBOGtheSavior/poker-equity-nn)** - Feed forward neural network built with Pytorch.

### Interests

- Building small-scale systems to explore big ideas
- Game development and real-time rendering
- Machine learning and data-driven design
- Workflow automation and toolmaking

### Philosophy

Observe. Build. Break. Learn.  
The tools may change, but the process stays the same.
